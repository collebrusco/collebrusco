Studying Computer Engineering at UT Austin, graduating Spring '25.      
        
#### My OpenGL [Graphics Library](https://github.com/collebrusco/flgl) is my most extensive project and I use it to write all my graphics apps.      
This [Fluid Sim](https://github.com/collebrusco/fluid-solver-toy) is a fun desktop toy that will build on any platform.         
         
See some works in progress: a [space flight game](https://github.com/collebrusco/adrift) with pretty shaders and a [sand/powder sim](https://github.com/collebrusco/gunpowder).     
      
Here is an [Entity Component System](https://github.com/collebrusco/ecs) I wrote for game dev.    

#### Class Projects: 
[Handheld dungeon crawler](https://github.com/collebrusco/ECE-319K-game-competition) for 319K and [RC dragsters](https://github.com/collebrusco/ECE-445L-final-project) for 445L.
