I've always been interested by computer graphics from vfx and games & it was the first thing I started messing with after learning about programming. I've been building up graphics and engine tools & working on games since (mostly concepts for games or the beginnings of tinkering with different engines & gfx).        
My OpenGL [Graphics Library](https://github.com/collebrusco/flgl) is my most extensive project, I use it for all of my gfx tinkering. 

    
#### Class Projects: 
These were [Handheld dungeon crawler](https://github.com/collebrusco/ECE-319K-game-competition) for 319K and [RC dragsters](https://github.com/collebrusco/ECE-445L-final-project) for 445L.
